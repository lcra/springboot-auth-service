# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Auth System

This project is a work in progress and actively under development. The architecture, features, and structure may evolve as implementation continues.

## Overview

This repository contains a complete authentication and authorization system based on Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). It supports secure user management, permission enforcement, and scalable architecture suitable for enterprise use.

### Stack

- Backend: Spring Boot with PostgreSQL
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Authentication: JWT (access and refresh tokens) with secure token management
- Deployment: Docker-based backend hosted on AWS EC2, PostgreSQL on AWS RDS

## Features

- Secure signup and login flows
- Role and permission-based access control
- Token blacklist and refresh mechanism
- Billing endpoint simulation
- Admin panel support

## Project Structure

- `api-spec.md` - REST API contract documentation
- `system-design.md` - System architecture and authentication flow
- `roles-and-permissions.md` - Defined roles, permissions, and mappings
- `user-stories.md` - Functional stories tied to each permission and role

## Getting Started

A full setup guide and development instructions will be added in a future release. For now, refer to the `system-design.md` document for architectural context.

## Status

Initial documentation is complete. Backend scaffolding is in progress. Contributions, suggestions, and issue reporting are welcome as the system takes shape.
